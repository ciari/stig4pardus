Kural_Basligi: A file integrity tool must verify the baseline operating system configuration at least weekly.
Aciklama: Unauthorized changes to the baseline configuration could make the system vulnerable to various attacks or allow unauthorized access to the operating system. Changes to operating system configurations can have unintended side effects, some of which may be relevant to security.\n\nDetecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid unintended, negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of the operating system. The operating system's Information Management Officer (IMO)/Information System Security Officer (ISSO) and System Administrators (SAs) must be notified via email and/or monitoring system trap when there is an unauthorized modification of a configuration item.
Aranacak_icerik: Verify the operating system routinely checks the baseline configuration for unauthorized changes.\n\nNote: A file integrity tool other than Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) may be used, but the tool must be executed at least once per week.\n\nCheck to see if AIDE is installed on the system with the following command:\n\n# dpkg -l aide\n\nIf AIDE is not installed, ask the SA how file integrity checks are performed on the system.\n\nCheck for the presence of a cron job running daily or weekly on the system that executes AIDE daily to scan for changes to the system baseline. The command used in the example will use a daily occurrence.\n\nCheck the "/etc/cron.daily" subdirectory for a "crontab" file controlling the execution of the file integrity application. For example, if AIDE is installed on the system, use the following command:\n\n# ls -al /etc/cron.* | grep aide\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root        29 Nov  22  2015 aide\n\nIf the file integrity application does not exist, or a "crontab" file does not exist in the "/etc/cron.daily" or "/etc/cron.weekly" subdirectories, this is a finding.

However, failure to keep operating system and application software patched is a common mistake made by IT professionals. New patches are released daily, and it is often difficult for even experienced System Administrators to keep abreast of all the new patches. When new weaknesses in an operating system exist, patches are usually made available by the vendor to resolve the problems.

Aciklama: If an account other than root also has a User Identifier (UID) of "0", it has root authority, giving that account unrestricted access to the entire operating system. Multiple accounts with a UID of "0" afford an opportunity for potential intruders to guess a password for a privileged account.

Kural_Basligi: All local interactive user initialization files executable search paths must contain only paths that resolve to the users home directory.
Aciklama: The executable search path (typically the PATH environment variable) contains a list of directories for the shell to search to find executables. If this path includes the current working directory (other than the user\u2019s home directory), executables in these directories may be executed instead of system commands. This variable is formatted as a colon-separated list of directories.

Aciklama: Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element. \n\nTerminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean that the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session and releases the resources associated with that session.

Kural_Basligi: The operating system must protect against or limit the effects of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by validating the operating system is implementing rate-limiting measures on impacted network interfaces.
Aciklama: DoS is a condition when a resource is not available for legitimate users. When this occurs, the organization either cannot accomplish its mission or must operate at degraded capacity.\n\nThis requirement addresses the configuration of the operating system to mitigate the impact of DoS attacks that have occurred or are ongoing on system availability. For each system, known and potential DoS attacks must be identified and solutions for each type implemented. A variety of technologies exist to limit or, in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks (e.g., limiting processes or establishing memory partitions). Employing increased capacity and bandwidth, combined with service redundancy, may reduce the susceptibility to some DoS attacks.
Aranacak_icerik: Verify the operating system protects against or limits the effects of DoS attacks by ensuring the operating system is implementing rate-limiting measures on impacted network interfaces.\n\nCheck the iptables configuration with the following command:\n\nNote: The command is to query rules for the public zone.\n\n# iptables -S | grep "\-m.*limit" | grep "\-\-limit-burst"\n\nIf a rule with both the limit and limit-burst arguments parameters does not exist, this is a finding.

Aranacak_icerik: Verify file systems that are being NFS exported are mounted with the "noexec" option.\n\nFind the file system(s) that contain the directories being exported with the following command:\n\n# more /etc/fstab | grep nfs\n\nUUID=e06097bb-cfcd-437b-9e4d-a691f5662a7d    /store           nfs           rw,noexec                                                    0 0\n\nIf a file system found in "/etc/fstab" refers to NFS and it does not have the "noexec" option set, and use of NFS exported binaries is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) as an operational requirement, this is a finding.
Cozum: Configure the "/etc/fstab" to use the "noexec" option on file systems that are being exported via NFS.

Kural_Basligi: The system must ignore Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) redirect messages.
Aciklama: ICMP redirect messages are used by routers to inform hosts that a more direct route exists for a particular destination. These messages modify the host's route table and are unauthenticated. An illicit ICMP redirect message could result in a man-in-the-middle attack.
Aranacak_icerik: Verify the system ignores IPv4 ICMP redirect messages.\n\nCheck the value of the "accept_redirects" variables with the following command:\n\n# /sbin/sysctl -a | grep  \'net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects\'\n\nnet.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects=0\n\nIf both of the returned lines do not have a value of "0", or a line is not returned, this is a finding.

Kural_Basligi: Wireless network adapters must be disabled.
Aciklama: The use of wireless networking can introduce many different attack vectors into the organization's network. Common attack vectors such as malicious association and ad hoc networks will allow an attacker to spoof a wireless access point (AP), allowing validated systems to connect to the malicious AP and enabling the attacker to monitor and record network traffic. These malicious APs can also serve to create a man-in-the-middle attack or be used to create a denial of service to valid network resources.
Aranacak_icerik: Verify that there are no wireless interfaces configured on the system.\n\nThis is N/A for systems that do not have wireless network adapters.\n\nCheck for the presence of active wireless interfaces with the following command:\n\n# nmcli device\nDEVICE TYPE STATE\neth0 ethernet connected\nwlp3s0 wifi disconnected\nlo loopback unmanaged\n\nIf a wireless interface is configured and its use on the system is not documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO), this is a finding.
